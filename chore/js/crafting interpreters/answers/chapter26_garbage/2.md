# 当扫描阶段遍历一个存活对象时，它会清除 isMarked 字段，为下一个收集周期做好准备。你能想出更有效的方法吗？

**时间戳/布尔值**

The basic idea is that instead of clearing the mark bit of every live object,
we simply redefine their current value to mean "not marked". In other words,
instead of "true" always meaning "marked", after each cycle, we toggle which
Boolean value represents the marked state. Since every live object will have
the previous version's mark value, toggling the definition of marked instantly
sets them all to unmarked.
基本的想法是，不是清除每个存活对象的 mark 位，而是简单地重新定义它们当前的值为“未标记”。换句话说，不再让“true”总是表示“已标记”，而是在每个周期后，切换表示标记状态的布尔值。由于**每个存活对象将拥有前一个版本的 mark 值，切换标记的定义会立即将它们全部设置为未标记。**

The implementation is fairly straightforward. In the VM struct, we add a new
field to store the Boolean value that currently means "marked":

```c
  bool markValue;
```

In `initVM()`, we initialize that to some value (it doesn't matter which):

```c
  vm.markValue = true;
```

Over in `sObj`, we rename the mark field from `isMarked` to `mark` to make it
clearer that `true` doesn't necessarily mean it's marked:

```
  bool mark;
```

Then we go through all of the code that uses `isMarked` and update it to the
new semantics:

```diff
 static Obj* allocateObject(size_t size, ObjType type) {
   Obj* object = (Obj*)reallocate(NULL, 0, size);
   object->type = type;
-  object->isMarked = false;
+  object->mark = !vm.markValue;

   object->next = vm.objects;
   vm.objects = object;
```

A new object starts off unmarked, so we initialize `mark` to the opposite of
the value that means "marked".
新对象一开始是未标记的，因此我们将 mark 初始化为与表示“已标记”的值相反的值。

```diff
 void markObject(Obj* object) {
   if (object == NULL) return;
-  if (object->isMarked) return;
+  if (object->mark == vm.markValue) return;
```

To see if an object is marked, we compare its mark value to the VM's. If they
are the same, the object is marked.

Otherwise, we mark it like so:

```diff
-  object->isMarked = true;
+  object->mark = vm.markValue;
```

When removing the weak references from the string table, we also check the mark
bit:

```diff
 void tableRemoveWhite(Table* table) {
   for (int i = 0; i < table->capacity; i++) {
     Entry* entry = &table->entries[i];
-    if (entry->key != NULL && !entry->key->obj.isMarked) {
+    if (entry->key != NULL && entry->key->obj.mark != vm.markValue) {
       tableDelete(table, entry->key);
     }
   }
```

Over in `sweep()`, we compare against the VM's mark value to check each object's
mark state:

```diff
   Obj* previous = NULL;
   Obj* object = vm.objects;
   while (object != NULL) {
-    if (object->isMarked) {
-      object->isMarked = false;
+    if (object->mark == vm.markValue) {
       previous = object;
       object = object->next;
     } else {
```

The whole point of this change is that other removed line. We no longer need to
clear the mark bit on each live object.

Finally, when `collectGarbage()` completes, we flip which value means "marked":

```diff
   sweep();

   vm.nextGC = vm.bytesAllocated * GC_HEAP_GROW_FACTOR;
-
+  vm.markValue = !vm.markValue;
```

This way, every object's current mark value now means "unmarked". OK, so what's
the performance gain here? On my laptop, with one little microbenchmark...
almost none. It was slightly faster, but small enough to be within the noise.
Does that mean this is a bad technique? It's hard to say. It might make a bigger
difference on other benchmarks or other machines.
这样，每个对象当前的 mark 值现在意味着“未标记”。好的，那么这带来了什么性能提升呢？在我的笔记本电脑上，使用一个小型的微基准测试......几乎没有。它稍微快了一些，但小到在噪声范围内。这是否意味着这是一个糟糕的技术？很难说。它可能在其他基准测试或其他机器上产生更大的差异。
