## 17. Governing law; arbitration

These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of England and Wales, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. The arbitration shall be held in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Website, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall be held in the jurisdiction of your most recent physical address or, if there is no such jurisdiction, in London, England. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in English courts. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
