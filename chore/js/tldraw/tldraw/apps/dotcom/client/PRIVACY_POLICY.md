## 3. Disclosure of personal information

We may disclose your personal information as detailed in this section.

### 3.1. Personnel and third party service providers

We employ personnel and engage other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your personal information with them to provide the Services. For example, all data that we receive is stored on servers hosted by third party service providers.

### 3.2. Affiliate

We may share your personal information with our affiliates as necessary for the operation, performance, and improvement of the Services.

### 3.3. Other users

Please note that all “shared” Whiteboards (those with URLs beginning with tldraw.com/r, tldraw.com/s, tldraw.com/ro, or tldraw.com/v) are public. As part of the functionality of the Website, any user who visits the unique URL for the Whiteboard will be able to see the Whiteboard, including any personal information you may have added to it, export a copy of the Whiteboard, or edit its contents. Accordingly, only include information in the Whiteboard that you are comfortable sharing with other users.

### 3.4. Business transfers

If we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

### 3.5. Legal compliance

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with governmental requests, law enforcement or court orders, or enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements.

## 4. International transfers

We may transfer the personal information of users from the European Economic Area or United Kingdom to the United States. When doing so, we rely on adequacy decisions, data transfer agreements, or other legally compliant mechanisms for such transfers, including standard contractual clauses. You can ask for a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out below.

## 5. Security

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. In addition, we rely on the technical safeguards provided by the third party service providers we use to host, store, and process your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that your personal information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, managerial, or technical safeguards.

## 6. Your rights

### 6.1. Rights of users in the EEA and UK

If you reside in the EEA or the UK and we are a controller of your personal information, you have the following rights:

#### 6.1.1. Request access to your personal information

You may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Where we have good reason, and where applicable law permits, we can refuse your request for a copy of your personal information, or certain elements of the request. If we refuse your request or any element of it, we will provide you with our reason(s) for doing so.

#### 6.1.2. Request correction of your personal information

You may request that we correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you.

#### 6.1.3. Request erasure of your personal information

You may request that we delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You may also ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your personal information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. You may not request the removal of de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data from our databases.

#### 6.1.4. Right to object to or restrict processing

In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal information (for example, if we are processing your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests but there are no longer any compelling legitimate grounds to justify our processing overriding your rights and interests). You may also restrict our processing of your personal information, for example during a period in which we are verifying the accuracy of your personal information in circumstances where you have challenged the accuracy of that personal information.

#### 6.1.5. Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party

In certain instances, you have a right to receive the personal information that we hold about you (or a portion thereof) in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. In such circumstances, you can ask us to transmit your personal information to you or directly to a third-party organization on your behalf. While we are happy for such requests to be made, we are not able to guarantee technical compatibility with a third-party organization’s systems. We are also unable to comply with requests that relate to personal information of others without their consent.

#### 6.1.6. Withdraw consent

You may withdraw your consent for our processing of your personal information where we are relying on consent to process that personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

### 6.2. Rights of all other users

Regardless of where you reside, if you would like us to delete your personal information, you can contact us as set forth in Section 6.3. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to delete this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. In addition, we may deny a deletion request if (i) the denial is necessary for us to comply with applicable law, or (ii) the request pertains to content that you posted on a Whiteboard and that cannot be deleted without impacting the Whiteboard experience for other users. You may not request the removal of de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data from our databases.

### 6.3. How to exercise your rights

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above and we are the controller of your personal information, please contact us at hello@tldraw.com. Please note that to protect your personal information and the integrity of our Services, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request.

### 6.4. Supervisory authorities

We welcome and appreciate the chance to address any concerns you may have about the Policy and our collection and use of your personal information. To the extent you feel like we have not addressed your concerns, and depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to make a complaint at any time to your data protection supervisory authority. For end users in the EEA, you can find contact information for each country’s supervisory authority [here](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). For end users in the UK, you can find contact information for the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on the ICO’s website [here](https://ico.org.uk/).

## 7. Retention of information

Subject to your right to request deletion of your personal information in accordance with Section 6, we will retain your personal information as long as needed for your use of the Services, our compliance with legal obligations, and to protect our or other’s interests.

## 8. How we respond to do not track signals

We do not track you or collect your personal information across third party websites or online services. Thus, we do not receive Do-Not-Track signals, or other similar signals. To the extent that we do receive any such signals, we will not comply with them as it is not an aspect of the functionality of the Services.

## 9. Age of users

Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use, access or register for the Services in any way. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 10. Changes to policy

We’re constantly trying to improve the Services, so we may need to change this Policy from time to time as well. The date of the last modification will be posted at the beginning of this Policy. It is your responsibility to check from time to time for updates. By continuing to access or use the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Policy.
