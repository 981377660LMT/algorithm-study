/*
This file contains our screenshot tool. The tool is a StateNode with the `id` "screenshot".

[1]
It has three child state nodes, ScreenshotIdle, ScreenshotPointing, and ScreenshotDragging. 
Its initial state is `idle`.

[2]
When the screenshot tool is entered, we set the cursor to a crosshair. When it is exited, we
set the cursor back to the default cursor. 

[3]
When the screenshot tool is interrupted or cancelled, we transition back to the select tool.
