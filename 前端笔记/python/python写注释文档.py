        """Convert an index pair (lists index, sublist index) into a single
        index number that corresponds to the position of the value in the
        sorted list.

        Many queries require the index be built. Details of the index are
        described in ``SortedList._build_index``.

        Indexing requires traversing the tree from a leaf node to the root. The
        parent of each node is easily computable at ``(pos - 1) // 2``.

        Left-child nodes are always at odd indices and right-child nodes are
        always at even indices.

        When traversing up from a right-child node, increment the total by the
        left-child node.

        The final index is the sum from traversal and the index in the sublist.

        For example, using the index from ``SortedList._build_index``::

            _index = 14 5 9 3 2 4 5
            _offset = 3

        Tree::

                 14
              5      9
            3   2  4   5

        Converting an index pair (2, 3) into a single index involves iterating
        like so:

        1. Starting at the leaf node: offset + alpha = 3 + 2 = 5. We identify
           the node as a left-child node. At such nodes, we simply traverse to
           the parent.

        2. At node 9, position 2, we recognize the node as a right-child node
           and accumulate the left-child in our total. Total is now 5 and we
           traverse to the parent at position 0.

        3. Iteration ends at the root.

        The index is then the sum of the total and sublist index: 5 + 3 = 8.

        :param int pos: lists index
        :param int idx: sublist index
        :return: index in sorted list
