This is an example of a branch copy immutable AVL BBST. Any operation on a node makes a copy of that node's branch. Because of this, this tree is inherently threadsafe although the writes will likely still need to be serialized. This structure is good if your use case is a large number of reads and infrequent writes as reads will be highly available but writes somewhat slow due to the copying. This structure serves as a basis for a large number of functional data structures.
这是一个分支复制不可变 AVL BBST 的示例。对节点的任何操作都会复制该节点的分支。因此，这棵树本质上是线程安全的，尽管写入操作仍然可能需要序列化。如果您的用例是大量读取和不频繁写入，这种结构是很好的，因为读取将高度可用，但由于复制，写入会稍微慢一些。这种结构为大量功能性数据结构提供了基础。
