B+ Tree B+ 树
Initial implementation of a B+ tree. Delete method still needs added as well as some performance optimization. Specific performance characteristics can be found in that package. Despite the theoretical superiority of BSTs, the B-tree often has better all around performance due to cache locality. The current implementation is mutable, but the immutable AVL tree can be used to build an immutable version. Unfortunately, to make the B-tree generic we require an interface and the most expensive operation in CPU profiling is the interface method which in turn calls into runtime.assertI2T. We need generics.
B+树的初始实现。删除方法仍需添加，以及一些性能优化。具体的性能特征可以在该包中找到。尽管二叉搜索树在理论上优于，但由于缓存局部性，B 树通常具有更好的整体性能。当前实现是可变的，但可以使用不可变的 AVL 树构建不可变版本。不幸的是，为了使 B 树通用，我们需要一个接口，而 CPU 分析中最昂贵的操作是接口方法，这又调用了 runtime.assertI2T。我们需要泛型。
